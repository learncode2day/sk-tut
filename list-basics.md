# List Basics

Lists are extra powerful variables. Instead of just a single name referring to a single value, lists can refer to multiple values, they can be looped, added to, cleared, and treated as if they're much more than just a single value. These properties make lists extremely useful for store data that changes per player, for data that requires a bunch of know locations, like warps, homes, or generator locations. Plus, when you're done with the data you can just delete it all at once!
