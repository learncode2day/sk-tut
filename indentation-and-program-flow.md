# Indentation and Program Flow

Skript requires that for each structure you create (ie: an event, a command, a function), you stick to a consistent pattern of indentation. This means every line in that structure has to follow the same rules. If the first line uses 2 spaces for a single level of indentation, the next line can't use a tab, or 3 spaces. Apart from that, though, you can choose whatever amount of spaces OR tabs (not both!) that you want.
