* Avoid if trees
* Well-named variables and functions
* Separate things on to multiple lines, avoid long lines
* Avoid excessive use of options
* Add comments around sections that are dense or confusing
  * there is such a thing as too many comments, but no comments is generally worse
* Use filters, use guarded events (specific ones), avoid contains
